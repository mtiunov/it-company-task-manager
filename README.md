# IT Company Task Manager

## Description

This project is a task management system for an IT company that has a team of developers, designers, project managers and quality testers. My team has many IT-related tasks. I decided to implement my own task manager, which will solve all possible problems during product development in a team. Each of the team can create tasks, assign them to team members and mark the tasks as completed (preferably before the deadline, of course).
